# Westview_DE_Capstone_Project_GameConsoleForEclipse

This repository is used to display my Digital Electronics final project (Capstone Project).
Partner: Michael Monrroy. His repo:

We wanted to create a handheld console that would be able to run games we made on Eclipse's IDE. In another class, AP Computer Science A, both Michael and I made 3 simple games using Eclipse, an integrated development environment for programing. These games were our own versions of Duck Hunt, Frogger, and our own original game.

During the project, Michael took charge of the coding to set up our display and games on the Raspberry Pi. Here's his repo with his code:

While I was focused on the controller's inputs using Arduino IDE to test our joystick and buttons. For refrence I used Science Buddies' video on coding a joystick using Arduino IDE:
