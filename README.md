# Westview_DE_Capstone_Project_GameConsoleForEclipse

This repository is used to display my Digital Electronics final project (Capstone Project).
Partner: Michael Monrroy. His repo:

We wanted to create a handheld console that would be able to run games we made on Eclipse's IDE. In another class, AP Computer Science A, both Michael and I made 3 simple games using Eclipse, an integrated development environment for programing. These games were our own versions of Duck Hunt, Frogger, and our own original game.
